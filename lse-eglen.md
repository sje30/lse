## How will the Rights Retention Strategy affect scholarly publishing?

In August 2021, the UKRI finally announced their long-awaited [revised
open access
policy](https://www.ukri.org/news/ukri-announces-new-open-access-policy/),
and from April 2022 will require authors to licence their accepted
manuscripts appropriately so that they can be freely shared.  Wellcome
have already required a similar condition for their grantees, termed
the *Rights Retention Strategy* (RRS).  I have written a
[primer](https://bit.ly/rrs-primer), on what this means for
researchers.  In essence, authors declare that any author-accepted
manuscript (AAM) resulting from their manuscript submitted to a
journal for publication can be made freely available without embargo.
This provides a pragmatic solution, free of author fees, commonly
termed 'green OA', as an alernative to the publisher-preferred model
of 'gold OA' where an article processing charge is often required.
UKRI see both green and gold OA as equally valid approaches to sharing
work.

As a researcher, I think the RRS is a valuable tool for us to retain
rights on our work, rather than handing over all our rights at the
manuscript acceptance stage.  Several publishers have already
responded negatively to this proposal.  However, despite their
objections, some of these publishers are now [publishing
manuscripts](Ross?) that have adopted the RRS language.

*Ross: should I just point to Dalmeet's piece to show you have found
numerous examples?*

So, now that the UKRI has joined other funders such as Wellcome in
supporting rights retention routes, what next?  How might publishers
and authors respond?

### Desk rejection of manuscripts

Many people are rightly concerned about enforcement of the RRS.  What
if a journal reviews and accepts my paper, but then asks me to sign a
copyright transfer form that e.g. requires me not to share my
author-accepted manuscript?  To date, most authors simply sign the
form to get their paper into press as soon as possible.  Authors,
rightly will want to avoid protracted copyright discussions that may
ultimately cause their paper to be rejected.

In response, I would suggest that journal editors are under no
compulsion to accept papers for review that use RRS.  If the editor
notes that the journal's copyright requirements will conflict with the
RRS, then the editor should simply desk-reject the paper rather than
risk a conflict at the acceptance stage.  I would however hope that
enlightened journal editors might have pause to think whether their
journal truly requires restrictive copyright transfer arrangements,
rather than simply a licence to publish the author's work.

### How many papers will be green OA vs gold OA?

The UKRI policy is ambitious in that it allows both green and gold OA
solutions for compliance.  Publishers may be hoping that most authors
will still prefer to take the gold route to open access, so that the
'version of record' (VOR) can be freely shared in most cases, rather
than the AAM.  However, the route to gold is looking increasinly
expensive, with few mechanisms to prevent their costs continuing to
spiral upwards.  Even with 'publish and read' deals in place, and
pledges of UKRI funds to support open access, funds are finite, and so
an author cannot assume that funds will always be available.  By
contrast, green OA is always available.

### Will hybrid journals disappear?

Judging by publisher's reactions, the biggest threat that RRS poses is
that it undermines 'hybrid' journals that are subscription-based and
charge APCs for papers to be made open access.  If used at scale to
support green OA, hybrid journals will lose APC income.  Libraries may
begin to unsubscribe from these journals if most of the content is
freely available, putting these journals at risk.  These journals may
therefore decide to return a pure subscription model (desk rejecting
papers that wish to use RRS), or flip to a gold APC model.

This does present risks, e.g. if most journals require APCs to publish
in, researchers and institutions with limited funds will be excluded
from publishing in those venues.  Waivers are sometimes available, but
are [not reliable or widely
available](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02173-7).  If we
wish to make publishing more equitable, we need a more reliable
solution than APC waivers (see next).  However, on balance, if RRS
means that hybrid journals will disappear, I think this is a good
solution to the current 'double dipping' problem where we are paying
both to read and publish in the same journal.

### Sustainable alternatives to publishing?

Irrespective of what legacy publishers may choose to do to respond to
this latest move, we should be mindful that there are many alternative
routes to sharing the results of our research, beyond sharing our
manuscript.  As research becomes increasingly digital, we are able to
share much more of our data and research artefacts (code, protocols,
results) generated throughout our research lifecycle.  If we view our
manuscripts as just one part of our scholarly output, we should be
looking towards infrastructure solutions that allow us to share these
valuable resources.

The preprint server arxiv just turned 30 years old, and is seen as a
valuable service by many in the mathematical and physical sciences.
It has inspired similar preprints in many other disciplines.  Arxiv is
[supported by grants and institutions](https://arxiv.org/about/ourmembers)(two of the four platinum members
are UK universities).  As well as hosting preprints, Arxiv is now used to
host diamond OA 'overlay' journals, which I believe provide a much
more sustainable way forward for publishing -- free to read and
publish.  Several other approaches worth highlighting briefly include:

1. [Subscribe to Open](https://subscribetoopencommunity.org/) using
   library funding to convert subscription journals to open access.
2. [The Open Library Of Humanities](https://www.openlibhums.org/) uses
   library support to provide open access journals.
3. [The Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/)
   relies entirely on free cloud infrastructure (github) to manage and
   host a journal.

By working internationally to provide reliable scholarly
communications infrastructure, we should be able to embrace
forward-looking publishers and initiatives that help revolutionize
publishing, rather than leaving us beholden at the hands of legacy
publishers providing a limited service.  The rights retention strategy
will hopefully play a small role in this revolution by allowing
researchers to retain rights over our work.
