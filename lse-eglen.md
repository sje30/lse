Ten years ago, open access

In August 2021, the UKRI finally announced their long-awaited [revised
open access
policy](https://www.ukri.org/news/ukri-announces-new-open-access-policy/),
and from April 2022 will require authors to licence their accepted
manuscripts appropriately so that they can be freely shared.  Wellcome
have already required a similar condition for work published by their
grant holders.  This is part of the 'Coalition S' package of work,
termed the *Rights Retention Strategy* (RRS).  I have written a
[primer](https://bit.ly/rrs-primer), on what this means for
researchers.  In essence, authors declare that any author-accepted
manuscript (AAM) resulting from their manuscript submitted to a
journal for publicatio can be made freely available without embargo.
This provides a pragmatic, zero-cost solution to open access, commonly
termed 'green OA', as an alernative to the publisher-preferred model
of 'gold OA' where an article processing charge must be paid.

As a researcher, I think the rights retention strategy is a valuable
tool for us to retain rights on our work, rather than handing over all
our rights at the manuscript acceptance stage.  Several publishers
have already responded negatively to this proposal.  However, despite
their objections, some of these publishers are now [publishing
manuscripts](Ross?) that have adopted the RRS language.


I think what I'd like to say, post UKRI announcement is to clarify that
although UKRI have not called the green route 'RRS' it is, by my view,
effectively the RRS and that there is now a growing body of papers that
are using it -- also hihglighting that although publishers in February
were against the RRS, those publishers are now accepting papers by this
route.

I'd also like to raise the question of what is the next move by the
publishers in the 'epic game of chess' we are playing out... will
publishers desk reject (doubt it)?  Will they hope only a small number
of papers go green (possible)?  Will they now flip all hybrid journals
to gold journals to capture the APCs? (possible?)

And should we, as researchers care what their next move is?  Or should
we proceed supporting more ethical initiatives like diamond OA /
subscribe to open?
